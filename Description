Hand Recognition System

This project is a computer vision-based hand recognition system that can detect, track, and interpret hand gestures in real-time. 
It enables gesture-based control and human-computer interaction without the need for physical input devices.


🧠 Key Features
Real-time hand detection
Finger & landmark extraction
Gesture recognition (e.g., counting fingers, open/close hand gestures)
Works with webcam or external camera
Easy to integrate with interactive applications (e.g., games, UI control)


🔧 Technologies Used
Component	Tools Used
Language	Python
Computer Vision	OpenCV
Hand Tracking	MediaPipe / Custom ML model
Environment	Jupyter / Python Script
Version Control	Git & GitHub


📌 How It Works
The webcam captures the hand.
The system detects hand keypoints (landmarks).
The gesture classifier identifies which gesture is being shown.
The output is displayed or used as a control signal.


🎯 Use Cases
Sign language interpretation
Touchless UI control
Robotics & automation control
Gaming and VR interaction systems


🚀 Future Improvements
Add support for more complex gesture sets
Deploy as a web app or mobile application
Train model for sign language recognition
